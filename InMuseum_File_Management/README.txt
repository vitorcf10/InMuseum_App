Project developed for file management practicing.
The application is called InMuseum, and it helps people visiting a museum to find at what place of the museum are located the works of art they want to visit.
The GUI is still simple, but all the functions behind are well implemented and tested. The file that contains the works of art data is organized with a BBST index.

See BACKENDS and EXAMPLES files in the docs/ folder, or on the web at: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/docs

Backends = Helper code to facilitate integration with platforms/graphics api (used by Examples + should be used by your app).
Examples = Standalone applications showcasing integration with platforms/graphics api.

Some Examples have extra README files in their respective directory, please check them too!

Once Dear ImGui is running (in either examples or your own application/game/engine),
run and refer to ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() in imgui_demo.cpp for the end-user API.
